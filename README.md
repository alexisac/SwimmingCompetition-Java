# SwimmingCompetition
The organizers of a swimming competition use a software system for registering participants. This system is used at various offices throughout the country. The software has the following functionalities: 
1. **Login.** After successfully authenticating, a new window opens displaying all the events (distance: 50m, 200m, 800m, 1500m, style: freestyle, backstroke, butterfly, mixt) that a participant can register for, and the number of participants already registered for each event. 
2. **Search.** After successfully logging in, participants already registered for a particular event can be searched. The application will display in another list/table all the participants registered for that event: the participant's name, age, and all the events in which the participant has registered. 
3. **Registration.** A participant can register for multiple events. Upon registration, the participant enters their name, age, and selects the events in which they want to participate. After completing a registration, all participants can see the updated list of events and the number of registered participants. 
4. **Logout.**
